# Grind Leetcode Weekly Contest

I can usually solve the first three problems in a Leetcode Weekly Contest but the last one is always tough for me.
However, I know don't know how to move forward, especially which problems I should practice because I found sometimes "hard" is pretty hard but sometimes it is just similar to "medium". Luckily, there is a rating system for every coder and problem.

Problem Ratings: https://clist.by/problems/?resource=102

My Coder Rating: https://clist.by/accounts/?search=shaoziqi&sort_column=n_contests&sort_order=desc&resource=102

Therefore, I will try a new strategy:

1. practice problems which is no more 200 higher than your current rating
2. practice categories which always let you in trouble

For myself, my current rating is about 1800, so I would practice problems from 1800~2000.

My nightmares are Dynamic Programming, String and Advanced Data Structures like Segment Trees.

### Dynamic Programming:
